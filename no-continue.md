# No Continue Workflow

Do not proceed with coding, deployment, or execution. Wait for explicit developer confirmation.

## Steps

0. Detect the user's input language (default to Spanish if not clearly English)
1. If no clear English indicators are found, default to Spanish for all responses
2. Describe the current status of pending features or issues in the detected language
3. Explain what actions are waiting for approval in the detected language
4. List any clarifications or decisions needed from the developer in the detected language
5. Do NOT proceed with any coding, deployment, or execution activities
6. Wait for explicit confirmation from the developer before taking any further action
7. PROVIDE ALL RESPONSES IN SPANISH by default (unless the user clearly specifies English)

**Language Support:**
- **Spanish**: Responder en español para entrada en español (default)
- **English**: Respond in English for English input
- **Other**: Respond in Spanish as default, but adapt to detected language when possible
