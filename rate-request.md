# Rate Request Workflow

Evaluate how well requests, plans, backlog items, or current pending tasks are understood before proceeding.

## Steps

0. Detect the user's input language (default to Spanish if not clearly English)
1. If no clear English indicators are found, default to Spanish for all responses
2. Determine the input type and source:
   - If input contains "plans/" or ".md", read and analyze the specified plan file
   - If input contains "backlog", retrieve and analyze current backlog items from memory
   - If input contains "pending" or "current", analyze current pending tasks from system memory
   - Otherwise, analyze the developer's general request
3. Analyze the content (plan, backlog, pending tasks, or request) to assess clarity and completeness
4. Rate the understanding on a scale of 1-10 in the detected language:
   - 1 = Very unclear, major gaps in understanding / Muy poco claro, grandes brechas en la comprensi칩n
   - 10 = Perfectly clear, complete understanding / Perfectamente claro, comprensi칩n completa
5. Provide a clear explanation of what is being evaluated in plain language and in the detected language
6. Highlight any assumptions that were made during interpretation in the detected language
7. If the score is low (1-5), ask specific clarifying questions in the detected language
8. If clarifications are provided and the input was a plan file, update the existing plan with the new information
9. Re-evaluate the updated plan and provide a new rating if changes were made
10. Do NOT proceed with coding, deployment, or execution until the developer confirms understanding
11. Wait for explicit developer confirmation before taking any implementation actions
12. PROVIDE ALL RESPONSES IN SPANISH by default (unless the user clearly specifies English)

**Language Support:**
- **Spanish**: Responder en espa침ol para entrada en espa침ol (default)
- **English**: Respond in English for English input
- **Other**: Respond in Spanish as default, but adapt to detected language when possible
