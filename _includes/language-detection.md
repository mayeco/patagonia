# Language Detection

1. **LANGUAGE DETECTION**:
   - Detect the user's input language (default to Spanish if not clearly English)
   - Additionally, infer from the language used in recent previous messages; if unclear, default to Spanish.
   - If no clear English indicators are found, default to Spanish for all responses
   - Always provide responses in Spanish by default, unless the developer clearly specifies English.
